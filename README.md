A TCP-like reliable transport protocol is implemented over UDP, supporting 3-way handshake (SYN/ACK), sliding window flow control, and connection teardown (FIN). Reliable data transfer is designed with packet sequencing, cumulative ACKs, one’s complement checksums, Go-Back-N retransmissions, and fast retransmit on 3 duplicate ACKs. Adaptive retransmission timeouts are also built using RTT estimation.
